Required Changes in the Analyzed Apps
Coursera – Redesigned Homepage Concept
Description of the Redesigned Coursera Homepage:

The redesigned Coursera homepage introduces a more personalized and modern learning dashboard. A “Smart Learning Hub” at the top dynamically updates based on the user's skill goals, progress, and past courses. The banner is transformed into an interactive carousel that highlights certification paths and top industry programs.

Category navigation is enhanced with icons and color-coded tags for clarity. Course cards receive slight visual upgrades with progress indicators, learning outcomes, and instructor highlights. A new “Skill Map” section visually displays the user's growth journey, recommending courses based on current industry trends. The redesign aims to make Coursera feel more interactive, motivating, and future-focused.

Udemy – Redesigned Homepage Concept
Description of the Redesigned Udemy Homepage:

The redesigned Udemy interface aims for a more organized and premium feel while preserving its marketplace variety. The hero section now rotates curated collections such as “Top Career Upskilling,” “AI Essentials,” and “Trending Tech Courses.” Promotional banners are simplified using stronger contrast and cleaner typography.

A reorganized category menu groups similar skills together, reducing clutter. Course cards now highlight instructor credibility, student count, and skill tags more clearly. A new “Path Builder” tool helps learners create structured learning sequences and track their progress. The redesigned page maintains Udemy’s engaging personality but adds structure, clarity, and improved discoverability.

Impact of Design Changes on User Behavior (A/B Testing)

A/B testing significantly influences how Coursera and Udemy refine their user experience. By presenting different homepage layouts or feature variations, both platforms measure changes in engagement, course enrollment, and retention.

For Coursera, A/B tests often compare redesigned dashboards, new recommendation algorithms, and reorganized learning path sections. These tests help determine which formats inspire learners to enroll, complete courses, or pursue certifications.

For Udemy, experiments usually focus on promotional banners, course card layout variations, and improved filtering options. Tests reveal which designs boost purchases, increase course page views, and reduce bounce rates.

Insights from A/B testing allow both Coursera and Udemy to fine-tune their UX, improve navigation, and adapt to changing learner behavior. This ensures smoother browsing, stronger motivation, and higher course completion rates.
